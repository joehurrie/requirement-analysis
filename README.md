# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

##  Introduction
This repository documents the **Requirement Analysis** phase for a **Booking Management System** project. It simulates a real-world scenario where clear, structured, and professional analysis lays the foundation for successful software development.

---

##  What is Requirement Analysis?
**Requirement Analysis** is a phase in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** where stakeholder needs are identified, refined, and documented. Transforming\\ ambiguous ideas into actionable and structured documentation that guides developers in building effective solutions.

### Importance in SDLC:
- Establishes a **clear project scope**
- Reduces **ambiguity and rework**
- Enhances **stakeholder satisfaction**

---

##  Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. **Reduces Project Risks**  
   Clear requirements minimize misunderstandings and reduce the likelihood of project failures.

2. **Improves Resource Management**  
   Helps prioritize features and allocate resources efficiently.

3. **Ensures Alignment with Goals**  
   Aligns the technical output with both **business objectives** and **user expectations**.

##  Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting raw data from stakeholders using interviews, surveys, and observations.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Refining and structuring gathered needs using workshops, brainstorming, and prototyping.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Translating requirements into formal documents like specifications and use cases.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Structuring requirements and visualizing interactions through models and diagrams.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Confirming correctness and feasibility with stakeholders to ensure mutual understanding.

##  Types of Requirements

###  Functional Requirements
These define **what** the system should do.

Example (Booking System):
- Users can search available rooms.
- Admin can add/edit/delete room listings.
- System sends email confirmation after booking.

###  Non-functional Requirements
These define **how** the system performs.

Example (Booking System):
- System should respond within 2 seconds.
- Must support 1,000 concurrent users.
- Data must be encrypted using AES-256.

##  Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams offer a visual depiction of how different **actors** interact with the **system**.

Key Actors:
- Guest
- Admin
- Payment Gateway

Key Use Cases:
- Search Rooms
- Make Booking
- Manage Listings
- Process Payment

---

##  Acceptance Criteria

**Acceptance Criteria** define the boundaries of a user story and determine when it's "done."

### Example: Checkout Feature

- User must be able to select a room and proceed to payment.
- Payment must be processed securely with confirmation feedback.
- Booking confirmation email is sent within 2 minutes after payment.

These criteria ensure the developed feature matches stakeholder expectations and can be reliably tested.
